# The Data Tells a Story

The hard part, of course, is figuring out what that story is.

I studied economics and creative writing at the University of Chicago, where I worked for Nobel laureate James Heckman, cleaning and analyzing data from small studies of early childhood education programs. After graduating, I spent a year teaching English in France, near Lille. I returned to the States to work for Professor Alison Morantz at Stanford Law School, where I gathered, cleaned, and analyzed data for projects on:

+ workers' compensation policies in large, multi-state firms
+ identifying characteristics of effective mediators in New York state
+ the effects of unionization on safety in American coal mines
+ using Bayesian time-series analysis to develop a targeting algorithm to identify coal, metal, and non-metal mines that are at particularly high risks for catastrophic accidents

Between stints at Stanford Law School, I received a Master of Fine Arts in fiction from the University of Georgia, and for the past year I've been teaching writing at the University of San Francisco (while doing some freelance data work on the side).

Fiction and data analysis might seem like disparate interests, but to me they both stem from a desire to understand the world: What does it mean for a coal mine to be "dangerous," why are some mines more dangerous than others? What influences the rates of injuries at workplaces, and how can we ensure both employers and employees are treated fairly? These questions, to me, are similar to asking what motivates a character, how someone will react to hiccups and earthquakes.
